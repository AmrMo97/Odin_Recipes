    <h2>Directions and Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
        Stir in rice; continue stirring until rice is coated with oil, about 3
        minutes. Add 3 cups water and 1 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil;
        reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and
        liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
    <br>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil
        over high heat. Stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the
        macaroni uncovered, stirring occasionally , until the it has cooked
        through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a
        colander. Return macaroni to cooking pot, cover and keep warm.
      </li>
    <br>
      <li>
        Soak lentils for 30 minutes. Drain and rinse; drain again. Bring 2 cups
        water to a boil in a pot and stir in lentils. Bring to a boil; cover and
        reduce heat to low. Simmer until lentils are tender 15 or 20 minutes.
        Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
     <br>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high
        heat. Cook the onions in the oil, stirring often, until they begin to
        brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Onions should be a nice caramelized brown
        color. Add garlic and cook another minute. Remove from pan, drain on a
        paper towel-lined plate.
      </li>
        <br>
      <li>
        Place half of the onion mixture into a saucepan. Mix in the vinegar. Add
        the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste, black pepper, 2 1/2 teaspoons
        salt, cumin, and cayenne (if using). Bring to a boil then reduce heat to
        medium-low and simmer about 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Serve by placing a spoonful of rice, then macaroni, and then the lentils
        on serving plates. Sprinkle with some of the browned onions, then top
        with tomato sauce.
