    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ (12 ounce) can Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Toppings:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) package Pepperoni</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps and Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium
        bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze
        remaining paste .
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt.
        Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute).
        Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough
        ball is formed.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth
        and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let
        dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch
        greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce,
        pepperoni and cheese.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly.
        For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks
        halfway through baking.
      </li>
    </ol>
